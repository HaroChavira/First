Hello!!

The program takes 8x8 pngs and compares there RGB values then guesses what number is inputted. It is very basic photo recognition. To run it you'll need to install the dependencies numpy, matplotlib, pillows, tkinter, and tkinterdnd2.
You will also need to download the folder of example images that the program will use to compare.

After that, just use a basic drawing app like windows paint and shrnk the canvas size to eight by eight. Draw a number on the canvas, save it, then drag and drop the file into the tkinter window.
Then the program will try and guest the number you drew.

Let me know if you have any questions at: tywhitaker586@gmail.com

Bye!!
